# Keylogger
A simple keylogger built in vscode for python that creates a text file and logs down every keystroke a user takes. If there are any bugs please feel free too fork this repository or improve my code.




I improved my original keylogger but kept the original there incase anyone wants it:
The new ones key improvements:
